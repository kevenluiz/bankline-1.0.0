# $ Bank Statement $

## About Me  

I'm Keven Luiz! I'm here to share my knowledge on this Android application using Kotlin.  

## Project Overview  

The **Bank Statement Android App** is designed to provide users with a comprehensive banking statement experience. Utilizing Kotlin, Coroutines, and LiveData, the app demonstrates modern Android development practices and architecture.  

### Key Features  

- Simplifies asynchronous calls with Coroutines  
- Implements reactive communication between the UI and ViewModel using LiveData  
- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java  
- Adopts Material Design for enhanced UI/UX  
- Consumes REST APIs for dynamic data retrieval  
- Integrates a PostgreSQL database for backend support  

The project follows MVVM and MVP architecture patterns, applying clean coding principles and adhering to Clean Architecture standards along with various design patterns.

## Description  

**Module:** Android Development with Kotlin  

1. Simplifying Asynchronous Operations with Coroutines  
2. Reactive Communication in Android Apps using LiveData  
3. Implementing Object-Oriented Programming Concepts  
4. Enhancing UI/UX with Material Design  
5. Consuming REST APIs for Dynamic Data  
6. Integration with PostgreSQL for Backend Services  

## Technologies Used  

- **Kotlin:** A modern programming language for Android development that enhances productivity and reduces boilerplate code.  
- **Coroutines:** A Kotlin feature for managing asynchronous programming, making the app more responsive.  
- **LiveData:** A lifecycle-aware data holder that updates the UI automatically when data changes.  
- **Android Architecture Components:** Libraries that help in designing robust apps with components like ViewModel and Room.  
- **Material Design:** Google's design system for creating visually appealing and consistent UIs.  
- **REST APIs:** Architectural style for interacting with remote servers and retrieving data.  
- **PostgreSQL:** An open-source relational database for backend data management.  
- **MVVM Architecture:** Separates UI from business logic to enhance testability and maintainability.  
- **MVP Architecture:** Focuses on presenting data to users and managing interactions through a presenter.  
- **Clean Code Principles:** Ensures code is readable and maintainable, using meaningful names and small functions.  
- **Clean Architecture:** A design philosophy that promotes separation of concerns and independent business logic.  

## Summary  

These technologies and practices work together to create a robust Android application that prioritizes user experience, efficiency, and maintainability, offering a complete solution for managing bank statements.
